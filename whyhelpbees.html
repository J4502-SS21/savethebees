  <p> Unfortunately, that’s the shocking future we face if we don’t work to help our most precious pollinator: bees.

Their hard work is not only essential to healthy ecosystems, but to sustaining animal and human life too. </p>

From apples and squash to buckwheat and coffee, bees are responsible for pollinating most of the fruits, vegetables, seeds, and nuts that are essential to our diets. Honeybees in particular play a huge role in agriculture, contributing over $15 billion to the value of US crop production.<p>
