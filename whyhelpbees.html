<h3> Bees pollinate one-third of the food we eat.</h3>
<p id="myParagraph"> <span id="mySpan"> Imagine a grey world without almonds, apples, or fragrant flowers…</span> </p>
<section>
  <p> Unfortunately, that’s the future we face if we don’t work to help our friendly pollinators. Bees play a key role in our survival, and they have been dying at unprecedented rates. Their hard work is not only essential to healthy ecosystems, but to sustaining animal and human life too. </p>
  <p>From apples to coffee, bees are responsible for pollinating most of the fruits, vegetables, seeds, and nuts that are key to our diets. Honeybees in particular play a huge role in agriculture, contributing over $15 billion to the value of US crop production.-TheBeeConservacy</p>

<h3>There are 5 Major Threats to Bees</h3>
<section>
  <ol>
    <li> <p> Habitat Loss
With the expansion of industrial agriculture and human development, many habitats have dwindled, fragmented, or disappeared completely.</p> </li>
<li><p> Climate Change
Changing climate conditions have caused dramatic shifts in temperatures, causing flowering plants to grow farther north and leave pollinator populations behind.</p></li>
<li><p> Chemical Pesticides
Harmful pesticides and other environmental pollutants  are a leading cause of pollinator declines.</p></li>
<li><p>Invasive Plant Species
When humans introduce new species into a novel environment, these plants may have a competitive edge over the native species and overtake the local ecosystem. This can result in a loss of food for local bees, whose diets have evolved to feed on local plantlife.</p></li>
<li><p>Diseases and Parasites
All of these factors have contributed to the spread of non-native parasites and diseases. Varroa mites have weakened  honeybee populations, while the German yellow jacket feeds on native bees and honeybees. Fungus like Nosema bombi has been common in bumblebee species in decline.</p></li>
