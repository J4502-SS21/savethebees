<p class="data">From a study done by BeeInformed.org, nearly 44% of U.S. bee colonies were lost from 2019 to 2020. Losses during Summer 2019 marked the highest ever recorded by BIP during that season, whereas losses during Winter 2019/2020 were the second lowest on record.</p>

          <h3>Why Bees are Important</h3>
          <p <id "beeImportance">Each year, bees are dying off in massive numbers throughout the U.S. and Canada. Bees polinate one-third of the food we eat today including fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts and more foods important to our diet. However, bees are in danger. More than half of the 4,000 native bee species to North America are declining in number, and 1 in 4 species are at risk of extinction.-TheBeeConservacy</p>
