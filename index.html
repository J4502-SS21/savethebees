          <h2>Why Bees are Important</h2>
          <p <id "beeImportance">Each year, bees are experiencing massive die-offs throughout the U.S. and Canada. Bees polinate one-third of the food we eat today including fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts and more all important to our diet. However, bees are in danger. More than half of the 4,000 native bee species to North America are declining in number, and 1 in 4 species are at risk of extinction.</p>
