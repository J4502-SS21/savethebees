<h2> Bee Life Cycle </h2>
	<p>Bees experience holometabolous development. This means that bee larvae look very different from adult bees, and transform through metamorphosis during the pupal stage. Bees pass through four stages of development: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.</p>

<p> The length and events of a bee’s life vary, depending on the seasons they emerge, what flowers they gather food from, and whether they are solitary or social. </p>

<p id="myParagraph"> <span id="mySpan"> Solitary Bees <br>
	Most solitary bees have one generation of adults each year and are only active for a short period of time. They tend to emerge when their favorite plants are flowering. As a result, different species emerge at different times throughout the year.
	Before becoming adults, most solitary bees go through a state of suspended animation called diapause. During diapause, bees are resistant to dry conditions and can conserve their energy for long periods. Some solitary bees can stay in this state for 10 years! Diapause allows solitary bees to wait for the right nest-building and foraging conditions. The offspring of these bees stay in the nest until the right conditions return.</span> </p>
	<p id="myParagraph"> <span id="mySpan"> Social Bees <br>
Social bees produce multiple generations of adult bees each year and are active for many months. Social bees can have annual life cycles (new nests are founded each year) or perennial life cycles (nests persist over multiple years).<br>
<br>
The life cycle of a social bee starts with a queen bee, who constructs a new nest in the early spring and cares for the first generation of workers until they reach adulthood. After the workers emerge, the queen stays in the nest to produce more workers throughout the summer. Her worker bees busily forage for nectar and pollen, build brood cells, and defend the nest.<br>
<br>
In late summer, the colony switches to producing reproductive male and female bees. Annual colonies, like those of bumblebees and sweat bees, perform this process over the course of a single year. Perennial colonies, like those of stingless bees and honey bees, engage in this cycle repeatedly over many years.</p> </span>
