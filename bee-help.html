<section>
	<ol>
	<h2>Go Chemical-Free for Bees</h2>
	<img class="pest"src="pesticide.jpg" alt="pesticide">
<li><p>
Synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, herbicides, and neonicotinoids are harmful to bees, wreaking havoc on their sensitive systems. Avoid treating your garden and green spaces with synthetics. Instead, use organic products and natural solutions such compost to aid soil health and adding beneficial insects that keep pests away like ladybugs and praying mantises.</p></li>
<h2>Provide Trees for Bees</h2>
<img class="tree"src="tree.jpg" alt="tree">
<li><p>
Did you know that bees get most of their nectar from trees? When a tree blooms, it provides hundreds — if not thousands — of blossoms to feed from. Trees are not only a great food source for bees, but also an essential habitat. Tree leaves and resin provide nesting material for bees, while natural wood cavities make excellent shelters. With deforestation and development on the rise, you can help bolster bee habitats by caring for trees and joining tree-planting parties in your area.</p></li>
<h2>Create a Bee Bath</h2>
<img class="bath"src="bath.jpg" alt="beebath">
<li><p>
Bees work up quite a thirst foraging and collecting nectar. Fill a shallow bird bath or bowl with clean water, and arrange pebbles and stones inside so that they break the water’s surface. Bees will land on the stones and pebbles to take a long, refreshing drink.</p></li>
<h2>Build Homes for Native Bees</h2>
<img class="beehome"src="beehome.jpg" alt="beehome">
<li><p>
Did you know that, with the exception of honeybees, most bees are solitary creatures? 70% of solitary bees live underground, while 30% live in holes inside of trees or hollow stems. Species like bumble bees build their nests in undisturbed land, and you can provide safe haven for them by leaving an untouched plot of land for them in your garden! “Bee condos” — which have small tube “apartments” — allow species like mason bees to take up residence. They’re easy to make or purchase. Our Sponsor-a-Hive program places solitary bee homes in gardens, schools, and communities around the U.S. and Canada.</p></li>
<h2>Become a Citizen Scientist</h2>
<img class="citizen"src="citizen.jpg" alt="Scientist">
<li><p>
Join a global movement to collect data on our favorite pollinators! Gather photos and other information about native bees and upload them to the iNaturalist app. Make it a group activity for friends by hosting a BeeBlitz event! Together, we can learn about the bees in various sites and cities and identify opportunities for nurturing them.</p></li>
<h2>Donate Beehives and Native Bee Homes</h2>
<img class="natural"src="natural.jpg" alt="Natural Bee Home">
<li><p>
Keep honeybees, nurture native bees, or help gardens and schools around the U.S. and Canada grow food and strengthen local environments. Our Sponsor-a-Hive program creates safe havens for precious pollinators in underserved communities by supplying the tools, gear, and education needed to successfully home bees. Donate to our program or apply to receive a home for your group or organization.</p></li>
<h2> Shop Local </h2>
<img class="honey"src="honey.jpg" alt="local shopping for honey">
<li><p>Local beekeepers work hard to nurture their bees and the local community. The easiest way to show your appreciation is to buy locally-made honey and beeswax products. Many beekeepers use products from their hives to create soaps, lotions, and beeswax candles. Plus, local honey is not only delicious — it is made from local flora and may help with seasonal allergies! You can also give time, resources, and monetary donations to local beekeeping societies and environmental groups to help their programs grow.</li></p>
